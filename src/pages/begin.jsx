                <p>
                  Badminton rackets weigh between 54 and 94 grams. The weight of
                  a badminton racket is indicated by the Latin letter “U” and a
                  number. The marking is usually indicated on the cap. As you
                  can see from the table, the lower the number, the heavier the
                  racket, for example, a 3U racket is heavier than a 4U racket.

                    We recommend adhering to the following principles: A heavier
                    badminton racquet will give you more power, while a lighter
                    one will give you more maneuverability. A feature of heavy
                    badminton rackets is that it is more difficult to make
                    technically accurate strikes with them. Also, a heavy racket
                    can cause fatigue in the hand during prolonged intense play.
                    There are training rackets weighing more than 100 grams.
                    These badminton rackets are designed to train the muscles of
                    the wrist and forearm.

                    Badminton racket handle size Rackets differ not only in
                    weight, but also in the size of the handle. The handle size
                    of a badminton racket is indicated by the letter
                    &quot;G&quot; and a number. There are 6 racket sizes: G1 -
                    G6. The smaller the number, the larger the handle. The
                    handle size is usually listed on the racquet cap in
                    combination with the racquet weight, such as 3UG4. Most
                    racquets are made in G4 and G5 handle sizes. If you are not
                    sure what size badminton handle you need, we recommend
                    getting a racquet with a thinner handle, as you can always
                    add extra grip to increase the size. Winding on the racket
                    (grip) is also used to provide a better grip on the racket.
                    Often, when buying a new racket, the flu is immediately
                    wound.

                  The balance of a racket, or the balance of a racket, is
                  determined by the distribution of the mass of the racket
                  between its head and handle. Depending on the balance, there
                  are three categories of badminton rackets. Head-Heavy
                  badminton rackets: Head-Heavy badminton rackets are designed
                  for players who prefer an attacking style of play.

                  tyle of play. With such a racket, the center of gravity is
                  shifted to the rim of the racket, which contributes to an
                  increase in the force of impacts and a greater attack
                  efficiency. At the same time, with a head-balanced racket, it
                  is more difficult to play defense due to less control of
                  maneuverability and it is more difficult to make a quick
                  exchange of blows. If you are an experienced player with good
                  technique and prefer an attacking style, we recommend that you
                  purchase a Head-Heavy badminton racket.

                  Badminton rackets with neutral balance (Even-Balance): The
                  Even-Balance badminton racket is a versatile tool for playing
                  a wide variety of games.The neutral balance of the racket,
                  i.e. the even distribution of its mass between the head and
                  the handle provides the badminton player with a combination of
                  high punching power, optimal maneuverability and accuracy.

                  The stiffness of a badminton racket&#39;s shaft determines the
                  amount of control the racquet has during play. Manufacturers
                  of badminton rackets implement four types of racket stiffness:
                  Highly flexible Flexible Medium Stiff When choosing a racket,
                  you should rely on the physical strength of your wrist and
                  your sports experience and level of training. A stiff racquet
                  has more impact energy potential, provides more control and
                  impact power, but only players with a fast and strong hand can
                  unleash it. If the athlete&#39;s hand physical
                  characteristics, playing experience, and training level are
                  more of a beginner or intermediate level, a hard and very hard
                  racket will be less effective in hitting hard. A flexible
                  racquet is less demanding on the athletes technique and
                  fitness, but such a racquet will generate less power on
                  impact, reducing control. The material from which the
                  badminton racket is made Materials and alloys used to make
                  badminton rackets iron;aluminum;alloy of aluminum and
                  graphite; graphite.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are planning to play all the time or are purchasing a
                  racket for a badminton player who trains on a regular basis,
                  we recommend purchasing only rackets made from
                  graphite,because other materials have certain disadvantages.
                  For example, metal racquets are easily deformed by the rim
                  (from string tension or impact), and the racquet may need to
                  be replaced quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, even if you are a beginner and are buying your
                  first badminton racquet (or planning to get a racquet as a
                  gift), we recommend purchasing a graphite racquet as the most
                  reliable and durable option. If you purchase a racket for
                  occasional, infrequent outdoor games, rackets made from other
                  materials will be a good option for you. Most likely, you will
                  not feel a big difference in quality, but you can save money.
                  Results: A well-trained athlete will suit Stiff and Medium
                  racquets. If you have an attacking style, you should choose a
                  head-heavy racquet. If you have a defensive playing style, you
                  should choose a racket with a balance in the handle
                  (Head-Light), and for a mixed style of play, a racket with a
                  neutral balance (Even-Balance) is suitable. Highly flexible
                  and flexible rackets are suitable for beginner athletes.
