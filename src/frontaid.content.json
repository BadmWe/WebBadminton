It features a counterbalance design for improved balance and control in three key locations: at the end of the handlebar, at the tee, and at the top of the frame. The new isometric rim shape enhances game stability from anywhere on the court. The upper part of the rim has become more flexible - so that the athlete can transfer maximum energy to the shuttlecock and increase the power of the mixes.",
